## Repo Instructions

1. Clone the assessment repository, open it in your working directory, commit your progress accordingly, and push the repository to share it with the instructors.
2. Read the instructions in the `README.md` file.
3. Start the project:

   ```terminal
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Edit `package.json` file by updating the `"author"` field with your Zoom name.
5. Edit **Thinking Process** section at the end of the `README.md` file. 👉 [Go to Thinking Process](#thinking-process)

## Project Goals

- In this project, you’ll be building an interactive terminal game.
- The scenario is that the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes, and they must navigate back to it without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside of the field.

## Project Requirements

- Your project is centered on a `Field` class.
- Give your `Field` class a `.print()` method that prints the current state of the field.

  > The Field constructor should take a two-dimensional array representing the “field” itself.
  >
  > A field consists of a grid containing “holes” (O) and one “hat” (^).
  >
  > We use a neutral background character (░) to indicate the rest of the field itself.
  >
  > The player will begin in the upper-left of the field, and the player’s path is represented by \*.

  ```js
  const myField = new Field([
  	["*", "░", "O"],
  	["░", "O", "░"],
  	["░", "^", "░"],
  ]);

  // Output:
  *░O
  ░O░
  ░^░

  ```

- Your game should be playable by users. In order to facilitate this, build out the following behavior:

  - When a user runs `main.js`, they should be prompted for input and be able to indicate which direction they’d like to `move`.
  - After entering an instruction, the user should see a printed result of their current field map with the tiles they have visited marked with the player's path. They should be prompted for their next move.

### Game Rules:

**1. Wins by finding their hat.**

**2. Loses by landing on (and falling in) a hole.**

**3. Loses by attempting to move “outside” the field.**

**When any of the above occur, let the user know and end the game.**
